## Minecrafting
Since making its debut in late 2013, Minecrafting has grown from a simple private vanilla server into a fully-fledged dedicated network. Its original founder, **MrLogano** *(MrDooms)*, continues to build on the server, and works in his spare time to bring exciting new updates to the community. 


### A different kind of server.
Minecrafting was first created out of a desire to play with friends in peace for free. Attempts to find a suitable server were not successful, and it was decided that the best way to avoid the most irritating elements of other servers was to create our own. 
Although much has changed, Minecrafting continues to uphold those founding principles, and as a result we do not offer a webstore, along with anything you would typically find in one. The server is not run for profit, and is maintained by its founder with the help of its community. 


### Small, but friendly.
Minecrafting has a small player base compared to many of the larger servers, but despite a lack of advertising, most of our community joined with friends and then kept coming back time and time again. As a smaller server, we are more able to interact with our community, and we can leverage this to act upon suggestions, fix bugs, or to simply drop in and have a look around their latest projects. Players in our community are kind and respectful, and eager to help anyone who may need it. Overall, the server has a nice, chilled environment for those who want to get away from the drama.


### Welcome to GitHub.
As a server owner, your job is never quite done, whether that be working on new features, fixing existing issues, or just upgrading to the latest version of Minecraft. To better understand the existing issues on the server, and to ensure their effective closure, GitHub is the ideal platform for managing that. It allows our community to submit any issues they find, with adequate information required to replicate, and then fix it. For those new to GitHub, you can find current and past issues [here](https://github.com/MrLogano/Minecrafting/issues).
